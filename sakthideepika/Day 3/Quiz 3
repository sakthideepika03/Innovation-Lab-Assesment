1-->Arrow functions are a shorter syntax for writing functions.
Syntax:
const add = (a, b) => a + b;

2-->A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function.
Useful for asynchronous tasks like API calls, event handling, and sequencing operations.

3-->Function Declaration is hoisted (can be used before it's defined).
Function Expression is not hoisted (must be defined before use).

4-->Global scope: Variable accessible anywhere in the code.
Local scope: Variable declared inside a function/block, accessible only there.
