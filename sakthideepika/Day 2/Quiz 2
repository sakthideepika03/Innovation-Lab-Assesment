1-->if checks the first condition,
else-if checks additional conditions only if the previous if or else-if is false.

2-->When checking multiple values of the same variable (e.g., constant comparisons).
It makes code cleaner and more readable than many if-else blocks.

3-->break exits the loop immediately, regardless of the loop condition.
Eg: for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  if (i === 2) break;
  console.log(i);
}
// Output: 0, 1

4-->while loop: condition is checked first, may not run at all.
do-while loop: runs at least once, then checks condition.

5-->Skips the current iteration and jumps to the next one.
Eg: for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  if (i === 2) continue;
  console.log(i);
}
// Output: 0, 1, 3, 4
